# 🛍️ Zara-Inspired Fashion Website

A fully responsive front-end clone of Zara's modern fashion website. This project is built using modern web technologies to recreate the sleek and minimalistic style of Zara.com.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React.js** – Component-based UI
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first responsive styling
- 📦 **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For interactivity
- 🧭 **Sliding Sidebar/Menu** – Mobile-friendly navigation
- 🔧 **Live Server** (VS Code) – For development preview

## 🐛 Known Issue

> ⚠️ The website appears **differently when opened using Live Server vs double-clicking `index.html`** directly.

This is likely due to:
- React or Tailwind relying on a local dev server
- Routing issues or relative paths
- CSS/JS not loading properly when not served from a local server
